# Arduino RGB LED Controller
Controls three LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) using the Arduino Uno.

This project uses the Arduino Uno to light up and cycle between three seperate LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, and 11.

## Hardware  
- Arduino Uno  
- Breadboard  
- LED (Red)  
- LED (Green)  
- LED (Blue)  
- 3 × 220 Ω resistors  
- Jumper wires

What I learned
- I learned how to properly connect and wire multiple LEDs with their resistors.
- I Learned how to properly connect the Arduino Uno to the Breadboard using the 5V and GND pins.

Possible Future Improvements
- Add more color combination and timing patterns.
- Integrate more options to change the colors at will.
