What I learned

I learned how to properly connect and wire multiple LEDs with their resistors.
I Learned how to properly connect the Arduino Uno to the Breadboard using the 5V and GND pins.
Possible Future Improvements

Add more color combination and timing patterns.
Integrate more options to change the colors at will.
